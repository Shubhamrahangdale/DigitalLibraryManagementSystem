## üöß Challenges and Reflections
## Challenges Faced
**Encoding Issues:**
         Encountered character encoding problems during compilation.
         Resolved by using the -encoding UTF-8 flag while compiling.
**Error Handling:**
        Implemented robust error handling to manage invalid inputs and unexpected 
        scenarios.
**Data Validation:**
        Ensured that all book details (title, author, and availability status) were correctly formatted and not left empty.


## üå± Future Improvements
**Database Integration:**
Integrating a database (e.g., MySQL, MongoDB) to persist book data.

**GUI Enhancement:**
Adding a graphical interface using JavaFX to improve user interaction.

**File-Based Storage:**
Implementing file I/O to save and load the book collection between sessions.

**Enhanced Search:**
Implementing search capabilities by title and author, in addition to the ID.
